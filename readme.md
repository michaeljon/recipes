# The Miller Family _Cooks Stuff_

This is the start of Caitlyn's cookbook. Sure, there are a few non-minor things on this list (particularly all the Margarita recipes) but most are things that we make often. Eventually
we'll get around to making this look like a real cookbook. Well, at least we'll make it so
it's nicely formatted so Caitlyn can take it with her wherever she might go.

This "cookbook" got it's start because Caitlyn loves to cook but wanted to make sure she
had "all the recipes" in hand in case she needed them. Many, but not most, of these came
from somewhere else but have been heavily modified to meet the weird dietary needs to the
Miller Family. They're not too weird that a "normal" person would find these recipes
strange or gross. In fact, quite the opposite.

Enjoy.

You can find the cookbook [in the PDF file](./miller-cooks.pdf).
