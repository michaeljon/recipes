\RecipeNameAndYield{Name=Habanero Simple Syrup, XRefLabel=habanero-syrup}

\RecipeStory{\lettrine{T}{his simple syrup is used} as the basis for both the grapefruit and mango margaritas. It can go in
    lots of other drinks too. Of course it can. Just make sure you don't get the habaneros in your
    eyes. Maybe wear gloves?}

\begin{IngredientsAndSteps}
    \ListIngredientsAndSteps
    {
        2 cups warm water

        1 granulated sugar (superfine is even better)

        2 habanero peppers, sliced
    }
    {
        Add all ingredients to a 1 quart mason jar. Shake until sugar is disolved. Refrigerate
        overnight to allow the syrup to chill and for the habaneros to impart their general
        goodness into the mix. After 24 - 48 hours in the 'fridge remove the habaneros with a
        slotted spoon.

\RecipeNameAndYield{Name=Mango Habanero Margarita}

\RecipeStory{\lettrine{I}{f you have some} very hot habanero pepper bitters then use those, otherwise use the
    recipe for habanero syrup. This makes a mess of margaritas. Well, two probably. YMMV

\begin{IngredientsAndSteps}
    \ListIngredientsAndSteps
    {
        8 \Ounce mango puree / juice

        2 \Ounce Habanero Simple Syrup

        5 \Ounce white tequila (and not the cheap shit)

        1\fr1/2 \Ounce triple sec / Cointreau

        3 \Ounce fresh squeezed lime juice
    }
    {
        If everything starts out cold then just mix this in a pitcher and pour it. We don't drink
        it with or over ice. That's no good. Why bother watering down something this tasty.

\newpage

\RecipeNameAndYield{Name=Mike-A-Rita, Yield=One. Only One.}

\RecipeStory{\lettrine{T}{his is the recipe} for the classic Mike-A-Rita. It goes nicely with the salsa. Hell, it goes nicely
    with just about anything. Because tequila. Makes one.}

\begin{IngredientsAndSteps}
    \ListIngredientsAndSteps
    {
        2 parts Don Julio Anejo

        1 part Cointreau

        \fr3/4 part freeze squeezed lime

        \fr1/4 part freeze squeezed lemon

        1 part simple syrup
    }
    {
        Measure it all out. Pour it over ice. This makes one Mike-A-Rita. Enjoy. Just in case you're
        wondering, I don't put any salt on the rim. It's a waste of good salt. However, sometimes
        it's actually kinda tasty to put a pinch of salt \textit{in} the Mike-A-Rita before you
        pour it. It's a personal preference and depends on whether the limes are really fresh
        and sour. Your call. I could go either way.
