        worry, it'll get brown spots on top in some spots. This is ok.

        Remove from oven and let the bars cool completely (yes Mom, completely). Then cut into

\RecipeNameAndYield{Name=Molasses Cookies}

\RecipeStory{\lettrine{O}{k, this is one of those recipes} that started out somewhere else, and
    over time, has been changed enough to be considered mine now. Just in
    case you're wondering, this is also one of those recipes that converts
    peopleinto molasses cookie fans. Even the ones who say they don't like
    molasses cookies. Just sayin.

    Makes 22 cookies. Yeah, don't ask. That's how many it makes. So, I almost
    always double this recipe.

    For the best flavor, make sure that your spices are fresh. Light or mild
    molasses gives the cookies a milder flavor; for a stronger flavor, use
    dark or blackstrap molasses (this is what I use). Either way, measure
    the molasses in a liquid measuring cup. You can use the five spices to
    tune this recipe to your personal taste. I tend to make the first four
    ``heaping'' sized, but keep the black pepper right around \fr1/4 \tsp.

\begin{IngredientsAndSteps}
    \ListIngredientsAndSteps
    {
        2\fr1/4 cups (11\fr1/4 \Ounce[s]) all purpose flour

        2 \tsp[s] ground cinnamon

        2 \tsp[s] ground ginger

        \fr1/2 to \fr3/4 \tsp ground cloves

        \fr1/4 to \fr1/2 teapoon ground allspice

        \fr1/4 \tsp black pepper

        \fr1/4 \tsp salt

        \IngredientsSeparatorClear

        12 \Tbl[s] (1\fr1/2 sticks) unsalted butter softened but still cool

        \fr1/3 cup packed (2\fr1/3 \Ounce[s]) dark brown sugar

        \fr1/3 cup (2\fr1/3 \Ounce[s]) granulated sugar

        \fr1/2 cup raw sugar (for rolling)

        1 large egg yolk

        1 \tsp vanilla

        \fr1/2 cup light or dark molasses (see the note above)

    }
    {
        Adjust an over rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 375\Degrees[F]. Line a large baking sheet
        with parchment paper.

        Whisk the flour, baking soda, spices, and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.

        Cut the butter into \Tbl-sized pieces and beat on medium with the sugars until light and fluffy
        (about three minutes).

        Reduce speed to medium-low and add the egg yolk and vanilla; increase the speed to medium and beat
        until incorporated (about 30 seconds). Be sure to scrape the sides of the bowl at least once. Reduce
        speed to medium-low and add the molasses; beat until fully incorporated (about 30 seconds). Scrape the
        bottom and sides of the bowl at least once to avoid globs of butter. Reduce speed to lowest setting
        and add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated. Once more with the scraping. This will
        take about 30 to 45 seconds.

        Use a \#30 cookie dough scoop to form balls and roll them in the raw sugar.
        Place 2 inches apart on the parchment-line baking sheets and bake for 10 minutes. The cookies will
        still look slightly undercooked. That's Ok. Don't try to bake two sheets at the same time unless
        you really trust your oven.

        Cool the cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet then move to a wire rack. Avoid the rush of people.

        Place 2 inches apart on the parchment-lined baking sheets and bake for 9 minutes until just starting

\begin{Tip}
    {After making these Bill, Min's dad, mentioned that he'd made oatmeal cookies in the past using
        Grand Marnier. That made me wonder if adding some grated orange peel would be good. Turns out that
        I had one of these that happened to be sitting very close to a Sumo orange and the flavor
        combination was \emph{nice}. So, I'm tempted to do this in my next batch.}

    make a really chunky version of our own peanut butter. Don't worry, we're going to add even more
    chunky peanut butter while we're going. These peanut butter cookies end up with a nice smooth texture
    because there's so much butter. If you don't like ``sandy'' peanut butter cookies then these are for you.

    These cookies, if done right, end up thick and chewy with just the right amount of slightly sweet-salty
    peanutty flavor. Oh, the honey, that's because honey is hygroscopic, which means it attracts water
    and helps keep the cookies moist. After you unwrap the butter keep the wrappers as they'll have just
    enough butter left to coat the bottom of the glass.}

    {I just happened to have picked a bunch of fresh lemons one morning when I

        just enough lemon juice to make a spreadable glaze. After the cookies are completely cooled,
        pour the glaze over them.

        Another alternative, since these are really light cookies is to grate 2 to 3 \Tbl[s] of
        lemon zest into the wet ingredients to create a simple lemon sugar cookie. If you do this you
        might want to cut the vanilla in half to 1 teapoon, increase the flour \fr1/4 cup and

\RecipeStory{\lettrine{T}{his recipe makes a bunch} of cookies. How many? Well, about 6 dozen. Doesn't seem possible does it? Well,
    if you follow the directions and use a \#20 scoop you'll end up with that many tasty bite-sized
    cookies. You can also use a \#30 scoop to get slightly larger cookies. Buyer beware though because
    these are really rich.}

\begin{IngredientsAndSteps}
    \ListIngredientsAndSteps
    {
        3 cups all purpose flour

        \fr1/2 teapoon baking soda

        1 teapoon salt

        1 cup butter, softened slightly

        1\fr1/2 cups granulated sugar

        \fr1/2 cup packed light brown sugar

        2 large eggs

        1\fr1/2 \tsp vanilla

        12 \Ounce bag white chocolate chips (2 cups)

        1\fr1/2 cups coarsely chopped macadamia nuts
    }
    {
        Preheat oven to 350\Degrees[F].

        Whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl.

        Cream the butter and sugars together until light and fluffy. You want to make sure you get
        enough air into the mixture and cut all that butter nicely.

        Add the vanilla and the eggs, one egg at a time. Beat the wet ingredients until quite smooth.

        Slowly add, about a cup at a time, the dry ingredients to the mixer and mix well.

        Once the dry and wet ingredients and combined beat on low-medium (3) until
        everything is smooth.

        Fold in the white chocolate chips and the macadamia nuts. Make sure they're well
        incorporated but do not over beat.

        Using a small \#20 scoop spoon the dough onto parchment-lined cookie sheets.

        Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until done or until just starting to turn golden brown.

\begin{ChefNotes}
    {Do not overbake these as they'll get quite dry and crunchy quickly. I tend to pull
        them a minute or so early (at 11 minutes) and let them finish on the baking sheet out of the oven.
        This leaves the cookies nice and soft in the middle with just enough crunch around the edges.}
